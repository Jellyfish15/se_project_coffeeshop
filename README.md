# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop
Project 2

"Triple Peaks Coffee Shop"

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I really wanted to see pictures and descriptions of each item on the menu as you hover over it. Also i thought since the "barista" has robot arms, it would be cool to implement "robot" aesthetic features sprinkled throughout the page in various ways.
